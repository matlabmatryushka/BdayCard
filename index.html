                            Whoever gifted you anything for your 28th birthday can't outdo me, because I made you the COOLEST present. üêª
                            I'm one of the rare people who can't give you a big hug on your special day - but I hope this card feels like a hug. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
                            I'll never know why you're so special to me, but for some reason - you are.
                            You're one of the most precious guys I know, you always make me smile, and I love our friendship so much. Thank you for always being there for me. ü•∞
                            Never stop being your authentic, funny, adorable self. Cheers to many more birthdays to come. üéÇ
